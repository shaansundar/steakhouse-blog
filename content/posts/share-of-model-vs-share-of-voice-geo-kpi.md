faq:

  - question: "What is the main difference between Share of Voice and Share of Model?"

    answer: "Share of Voice (SoV) traditionally measures your brand's visibility in search engine rankings and advertising impressions relative to competitors. In contrast, Share of Model (SoM) measures how frequently and favorably your brand is mentioned, cited, or recommended by generative AI models (like ChatGPT or Gemini) and AI Overviews. While SoV focuses on links and clicks, SoM focuses on being part of the synthesized answer provided to the user."

  - question: "How can I improve my brand's Share of Model?"

    answer: "Improving Share of Model requires a strategy called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). This involves creating high-authority, long-form content rich in unique statistics and expert quotes (Information Gain). You must also focus on Entity SEO to clearly define your brand's offerings and use structured data (Schema.org) to make your content easily readable by AI crawlers. Consistency across your digital footprint helps LLMs confidently associate your brand with specific solutions."

  - question: "Why is structured data important for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?"

    answer: "Structured data, such as JSON-LD schema, acts as a direct communication line to search engines and AI models, explicitly describing the content on your page (e.g., identifying a section as an FAQ or a software review). This reduces ambiguity and helps AI systems parse and verify your information faster. By reducing the computational effort required to understand your content, you increase the likelihood of being cited as a trusted source in direct answers."

  - question: "Can small B2B SaaS startups compete for Share of Model against enterprise giants?"

    answer: "Yes, actually more effectively than in traditional SEO. LLMs prioritize relevance and information quality over domain age or sheer backlink volume. A startup that publishes highly specific, data-rich, and technically structured content can out-perform a generic enterprise competitor in AI citations. By focusing on niche authority and providing unique insights that large competitors overlook, small teams can dominate the 'context window' for specific queries."

  - question: "What role does content automation play in GEO strategies?"

    answer: "Content automation is essential for GEO because of the sheer depth required to win. Winning Share of Model requires building comprehensive topic clusters that cover every angle of a subject to establish topical authority. Tools like Steakhouse Agent allow teams to scale this production without sacrificing quality, ensuring that every piece of content is structured, entity-optimized, and formatted for machine readability (markdown) from day one."

# Share of Model vs. Share of Voice: The New KPI for B2B SaaS Growth

**Tl;Dr:** Share of Model (SoM) is the frequency with which a brand is cited, recommended, or synthesized by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Answer Engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. Unlike traditional Share of Voice (SoV), which measures visibility across search rankings and ad impressions, SoM measures a brand's presence within the generative output of AI. For B2B SaaS, optimizing for SoM through Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is now critical, as decision-makers increasingly rely on AI agents rather than search engines to vet software solutions.

## The Shift: Why Traditional Metrics Are Failing B2B SaaS

For the last decade, B2B marketing leaders have lived and died by "Share of Voice" (SoV). The formula was relatively straightforward: outbid competitors on keywords, dominate the top three organic spots on Google, and saturation would eventually lead to market share. However, as we move deeper into the generative era of search, this linear relationship is breaking down.

Recent data suggests that by 2025, a significant percentage of traditional informational queries will never result in a click to a website. Instead, users—especially technical buyers and founders—are turning to answer engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Google's AI Overviews to conduct vendor research. They aren't looking for a list of links; they are looking for a synthesized answer, a comparison table, or a direct recommendation.

In this environment, ranking #1 for a keyword is less valuable than being the *primary entity* cited in an LLM's answer. If an AI summarizes the "best automated SEO content generation tools" and your brand isn't in the generated output, you simply do not exist to that user. This shift demands a migration from tracking Share of Voice to optimizing for **Share of Model**.

This article explores what Share of Model is, why it requires a fundamental pivot in content strategy, and how B2B SaaS companies can use Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) to secure their place in the AI-driven future.

## What is Share of Model (SoM)?

Share of Model (SoM) is a metric that quantifies a brand's visibility and authority within the latent space of Large Language Models. It represents the probability that an LLM will mention, cite, or recommend a specific brand when prompted with relevant queries about a problem set, industry, or product category. Unlike Share of Voice, which is calculated based on search volume and rank position, Share of Model is influenced by **entity density, information gain, and citation bias** within the model's training data and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) sources.

## Share of Voice vs. Share of Model: The Core Differences

Understanding the transition from SoV to SoM requires looking at the mechanics of how information is retrieved. Traditional search engines are indexers; they fetch and rank documents. Answer engines are synthesizers; they read, understand, and generate new content based on those documents.

Here is how the two metrics differ in practice:

      <th>Share of Voice (Traditional SEO)</th>
      <th>Share of Model (GEO & AEO)</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Primary Goal</strong></td>
      <td>Rank high on a SERP to drive clicks.</td>
      <td>Be cited or synthesized in the answer.</td>

    <tr>
      <td><strong>Optimization Focus</strong></td>
      <td>Keywords, Backlinks, URL Structure.</td>
      <td>Entities, Structured Data, Information Gain.</td>

      <td><strong>User Behavior</strong></td>
      <td>User scans list, clicks link, reads page.</td>
      <td>User reads AI summary; zero-click consumption.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Measurement</strong></td>
      <td>Rank Position, CTR, Organic Traffic.</td>
      <td>Citation Frequency, Sentiment, Brand Association.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Content Style</strong></td>
      <td>Skimmable, keyword-rich, often fluffy.</td>
      <td>Dense, authoritative, data-rich, structured.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## The Mechanics of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

To increase Share of Model, marketing teams must adopt **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**. This is not merely "SEO with AI tools"; it is a distinct discipline focused on optimizing content for the specific heuristics that LLMs prefer. Research into GEO indicates that models display specific biases—such as citation bias and quotation bias—that smart brands can leverage.

### 1. Entity-First Semantics
LLMs do not think in keywords; they think in vectors and entities. An entity is a distinct concept (e.g., "Steakhouse Agent," "SaaS," "GitHub"). To capture Share of Model, your content must clearly define the relationships between your brand and the problems it solves. This requires building a "Knowledge Graph" via your content strategy. Instead of writing ten disparate blog posts targeting long-tail keywords, you must build a cohesive cluster of content that reinforces the connection between your brand entity and specific attributes like "enterprise GEO platform" or "automated structured data."

### 2. Information Gain and Unique Value
One of the strongest signals for an LLM to cite a source is **Information Gain**. If your article repeats the same generic advice found on the top 10 HubSpot or Forbes articles, the LLM has no reason to cite you. It will simply aggregate the consensus. To win Share of Model, you must provide net-new information. This includes:
*   **Proprietary Data:** Original statistics or benchmarks from your own platform usage.
*   **Contrarian Viewpoints:** Arguments that challenge the status quo (e.g., "Why Keyword Research is Dead").
*   **Specific Frameworks:** Naming your methodologies (e.g., "The OmniGEO Framework") so the model treats them as distinct entities.

### 3. Structural Extractability
Answer engines are voracious readers, but they prefer structured inputs. Content that is formatted in clean Markdown, utilizes Schema.org (JSON-LD), and presents data in HTML tables is significantly easier for a machine to parse and verify. This is why platforms like **Steakhouse Agent** prioritize Markdown-first publishing. By ensuring the underlying code of the content is semantically rigid, you reduce the "hallucination risk" for the AI, making it a safer and more attractive source to cite.

## How to Measure Share of Model

Because SoM is a nascent metric, there is no single "Google Analytics" for it yet. However, forward-thinking growth engineers are using proxy methods to track their standing.

### The "Share of Recommendation" Audit
The most direct way to measure SoM is to audit the major answer engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini) with buyer-intent prompts. 

**Example Prompt:**
> "I am a B2B SaaS marketing director looking for software to automate long-form content creation that is optimized for AI search. What are the top 3 tools I should consider and why?"

**Scoring Methodology:**
*   **Mentioned:** Did the brand appear in the list? (1 point)
*   **First Position:** Was it the first recommendation? (3 points)
*   **Exclusive Feature:** Did the AI mention a specific differentiator (e.g., "Steakhouse's integration with GitHub")? (5 points)
*   **Negative/Neutral:** Was the sentiment positive? (-5 points if negative).

Running this audit monthly across different model versions (e.g., GPT-4o vs. GPT-o1) provides a trendline for your Share of Model.

### Share of Voice in AI Overviews (AIO)
Google's AI Overviews act as a bridge between traditional search and pure LLM answers. Tracking how often your domain is cited in the "carousel" or the text of an AI Overview for your target keywords is a quantifiable metric. Tools are beginning to emerge that track AIO visibility, but manual spot-checking high-value queries remains a necessary validation step.

## Strategies to Increase Your Share of Model

Once you accept that SoM is the goal, your content production workflow must change. High-volume, low-quality "SEO filler" actively hurts your Share of Model because it dilutes your entity density with noise.

### 1. Automate Authority with Human Oversight
To dominate SoM, you need volume *and* depth. This is a paradox for human writers, who struggle to scale deep technical content. This is where AI-native content automation fits in. Using a tool like **Steakhouse Agent** allows teams to generate comprehensive, 2,000+ word deep dives that are pre-optimized for GEO traits (citations, stats, quotes). The goal is to flood the vector space with high-quality, structured content that reinforces your brand's expertise without burning out your marketing team.

### 2. Optimize for "Quotation Bias"
Research suggests that LLMs are more likely to cite content that contains authoritative quotes and clear, definitive statements. Avoid wishy-washy language like "it depends" or "sometimes." Instead, make strong, citable claims. 

*   **Weak:** "Some marketers think AEO is important."
*   **Strong:** "Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the single biggest shift in search since the introduction of mobile-first indexing."

The latter is more likely to be picked up as a snippet or a direct quote by an answer engine.

### 3. The Power of the Topic Cluster
LLMs understand context through proximity. If you want to be known for "GEO software for B2B SaaS," you cannot just write one article about it. You need a cluster of 10-20 interlinked articles covering every facet: implementation, pricing, case studies, technical integration, and comparisons. This signals to the model that your domain is a definitive source of truth (Topical Authority). Automating the creation of these clusters ensures that the internal linking logic is semantically sound, further helping the bots crawl and understand your site structure.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Share of Model

As organizations rush to adapt to this new reality, many fall into traps that damage their standing with AI models.

*   **Mistake 1: Blocking AI Crawlers.** Some brands, fearing copyright issues, block `GPTBot` or `CCBot` via `robots.txt`. While this protects your IP, it ensures you will have **zero** Share of Model. If the model cannot read your site, it cannot recommend you.
*   **Mistake 2: Ignoring Structured Data.** Relying solely on visual HTML tags (H1, H2) is insufficient. You must implement JSON-LD schema (FAQPage, Article, SoftwareApplication) to explicitly tell the machine what your content is. 
*   **Mistake 3: Brand Inconsistency.** If your website calls your product a "platform" but your LinkedIn calls it a "tool" and your help docs call it a "service," you confuse the entity association. Consistency across all digital footprints helps the model resolve your identity with higher confidence.
*   **Mistake 4: Fluff over Density.** Traditional SEO encouraged 500-word blog posts. GEO demands long-form, comprehensive guides. An LLM regards a 3,000-word guide with unique data as a higher-weight node than a 500-word summary.

## The Role of Infrastructure in Content Strategy

Finally, the infrastructure you use to publish content matters more than ever. Traditional CMS setups often inject bloat code that confuses scrapers. A **markdown-first approach**, typically associated with developer blogs, is becoming the gold standard for AEO. 

By treating content as code—stored in Git, version-controlled, and compiled into clean HTML—you ensure maximum extractability. Platforms that automate this workflow, taking raw brand positioning and converting it into Git-backed markdown, bridge the gap between marketing needs and engineering-grade structure. This technical foundation is often the tie-breaker when an algorithm decides which source to trust.

## Conclusion: The First-Mover Advantage

We are currently in the "Wild West" phase of Generative Engine Optimization. The brands that establish their Share of Model now—by defining their entities, publishing high-information-gain content, and structuring their data for machines—will become the "canonical" answers in the training data of future models. 

Share of Voice was about shouting the loudest in a crowded room. Share of Model is about being the wisest person in the room that everyone else quotes. For B2B SaaS, the transition is not optional; it is the only path to sustainable growth in an AI-first world.
